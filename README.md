# ghar-bar
This project is my take on developing a web app for shopping alcohol online and setup a keen bar at home. Hence, the name Ghar-Bar.

As of now, I'll be working on Next.js alongwith Redux and Redux-Saga implementation in this project and will be trying to make it a good SEO optimised web app.

DISCLAIMER:
This is not at all going to be a commercial project. Fellow developers are open-heartedly invited to contribute, learn and share knowledge. Kudos!
